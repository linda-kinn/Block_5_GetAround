* Question 1 : How often are drivers late for the next check-in ?
* Question 2 : How does it impact the next driver ?
* Question 3 : How many problematic cases will it solve depending on the chosen threshold and scope ?
* Question 4 : How many rentals would be affected by the feature depending on the threshold and scope we choose ?
* Question 5 : Which share of our ouwner's revenue would potentially be affected by the feature ?

By those questions, we have to decide :
* Threshold : How long should the mininum delay be ?
* Scope : Should we enable the feature for all cars ?, only Connect cars ?
